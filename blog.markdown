Cooperative Security is a novel "stealth" startup applying for SBIR grants. We are researching the intersections of infrastructural development, AI alignment, and human flourishing, with a special interest in how traditionally marginalized populations can relate to the economic impacts of rapid AI development. We are leveraging SBIR grants to build a set of experts in distributed technologies, prioritizing distributed hash tables and AI-enabled secure development. The "Cooperative" facet of our name is rooted in our principles of collaboration, longtermism, and solarpunk ideals.
